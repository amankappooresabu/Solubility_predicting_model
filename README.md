# Solubility_predicting_model

## Description

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning, specifically linear regression, to predict the solubility of molecules based on their descriptors. The project follows these steps:

1. **Load data:** Imports a dataset containing molecular descriptors and solubility values.
2. **Data preparation:** Separates the data into features (X) and target (y), and splits it into training and testing sets.
3. **Model building:** Creates and trains a linear regression model using the training data.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluates the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2).
5. **Visualization:** Creates a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between experimental and predicted solubility values.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the notebook cells sequentially to execute the code.

## Results

The model's performance is evaluated using MSE and R2 scores for both the training and testing sets. The results are displayed in a table. A scatter plot is also generated to visualize the relationship between experimental and predicted solubility values.
